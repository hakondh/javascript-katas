# how-many-shuffles

This program performs an out-shuffle, also known as an out Faro shuffle or a perfect shuffle, which is a controlled method for shuffling playing cards.

It's done by splitting the deck into two equal halves and interleaving them together perfectly, with the condition that the top card
remains in place.

An example of an out-shuffle:

`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,] âžž [1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 8]`
